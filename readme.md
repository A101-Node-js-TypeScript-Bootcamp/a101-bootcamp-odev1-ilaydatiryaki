# Javascript - Typescript

# What is JavaScript? 

JavaScript is a language that helps create interactive web pages. Works in a web browser without the need for any resources from the web server, following client-side programming rules. At the same time, JS is designed for large complex applications. JS is also an easy-to-learn language when working on the client and server side.

# What is TypeScript?

TypeScript; JS development in a modern age is a language compiled to write clear and simple JS code. JS can also be seen as a development language. A large JS project can be easily written with the TS application, in which case it provides more robust software development. With TypeScript, developers can use existing JavaScript code. It can be included in popular JavaScript libraries. It can be called from JavaScript code.


# JavaScript and TypeScript Differences

JavaScript is a scripting language that helps create interactive web pages. TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript. At the same time, when TypeScript is static, JS helps create interactive web pages. While JavaScript code does not need to be compiled, TypeScript code must be compiled. TypeScript, which compares TypeScript and JavaScript, supports a prototyping feature, while JavaScript does not. Typescript is a powerful writing system that includes Javascript features for large-scale projects. However, JavaScript is an ideal option for small-sized projects. TypeScript uses concepts such as types and interfaces to identify the data used; however, javascript does not have such a concept.


# Why was TypeScript developed over JavaScript?


When people use javascript developers have learned that javascript can also be used as a server-side programming language. As JS grew, the codes became complex and heavy. Therefore, JavaScript was unable to fully meet the requirements of an object-oriented programming language. This situation prevented JS from being successful at the enterprise level as a server-side technology. Then TypeScript was developed by the development team to solve this problem.
